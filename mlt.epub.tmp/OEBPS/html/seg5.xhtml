<h3 class="segment-team-bios">About the Authors</h3>
<div class="author-figure"><img src="graphics/img1.jpg"  alt="" title="" /></div>
<p><em>Matthijs Hollemans</em> is an author on this book. After many years of handcrafting his logic with if-then-else statements, Matthijs finally saw the light and switched to machine learning, teaching computers to come up with those if-then-else statements by themselves. Why write programs when computers can write their own? Matthijs also lifts heavy things in the gym and plays heavy things on his guitar. Matthijs blogs about iOS machine learning at <a href="http://www.machinethink.net">machinethink.net</a>. You can find him on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/@mhollemans">@mhollemans</a>.

<p><em>Chris LaPollo</em> is an author of this book. He&apos;s currently an independent developer and consultant focused on combining machine learning with his software engineering experience to solve problems previously considered too complex to handle with only hard-coded logic. He enjoys participating in game jams and relaxing with his family, and he&apos;s becoming an OK cook. Find him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/@ChrisLaPollo">@ChrisLaPollo</a>.

<p><em>Audrey Tam</em> is an author on this book. As a retired computer science academic, she&apos;s a technology generalist with expertise in translating new knowledge into learning materials. Audrey has a PhD in applied math, so is especially good at dis-intimidating machine learning math. Audrey now teaches short courses in iOS app development to non-programmers and attends nearly all Melbourne Cocoaheads monthly meetings. She also enjoys long train journeys, knitting and trekking in the Aussie wilderness.
