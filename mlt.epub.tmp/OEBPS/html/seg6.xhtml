<h1 class="segment-chapter">What you need</h1>

<p>To follow along with this book, you&apos;ll need the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Mac running <em>Mojave</em> (10.14) or later. Earlier versions might work, but they&apos;re untested. To follow along with some of the chapters, you will need <em>Mojave</em> (10.14).
</p></li>

<li>
<p><em>Xcode 10.2 or later.</em> Xcode is the main development tool for iOS. You&apos;ll need Xcode 10.2 or later for the tasks in this book. You can download the latest version of Xcode from Apple&apos;s developer site here: <a href="http://apple.co/2asi58y">apple.co/2asi58y</a>
</p></li>

<li>
<p><em>One or more devices (iPhone, iPad) running iOS 11 or later.</em> Some of the examples in this book will run in the iOS 11 Simulator that comes with Xcode but most chapters require a physical iOS device for testing. The device must have an A9 processor or better.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven&apos;t installed the latest version of macOS or Xcode, be sure to do that before continuing with the book. The code covered in this book depends on Swift 4 and Xcode 10 â€” you may get lost if you try to work with an older version.
